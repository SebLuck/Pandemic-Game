# Pandemic-Game-Java
This project is a game coded in Java which is based on the popular cooperative game pandemic.  

In this game only two players can play the game, and there are only 4 epidemic cards in the player deck. Additionally, there are 4 event cards: Government Grant, One Quiet Night, Airlift, and Resilient Population. There are 52 cards in total in the player deck and 48 cards in the infection deck. The game includes only 3 roles: Scientist, Researcher, and Medic.

# Description

The code is executed using a text file that stores all the cities and their connections. An image is also used to display all the connections between cities, helping the player to understand how to reach a city. The program starts by giving the user the option to start the game or exit it. When the user chooses to start the game, each player must choose their role, and they will receive an explanation of their role. The program instructs the user to type '1' to proceed to the next step, such as drawing infection or player cards. When the turn of a player starts, the player has access to a menu with twelve different options.
